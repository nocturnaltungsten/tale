# tale: Phase 2.7 Repository Cleanup & Organization Roadmap

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "2.7.1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Completes implementation with specific deliverables
4. Commits changes before context fills
5. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes

## Phase 2.7: Repository Cleanup & Organization
**Source:** Repository clutter and inconsistency analysis
**Goal:** Eliminate clutter, organize structure, reduce complexity

### 2.7.CLEANUP - Root Directory Organization (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

#### 2.7.1 - Root Directory Cleanup
```
TASK: Remove all temporary files and development artifacts from root directory
PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Essential for repository organization
DELIVERABLES:
- Delete: .coverage, audit-report.json, tale.db, .DS_Store files
- Remove: archive/, checkpoints/, htmlcov/ directories
- Consolidate: keep only .venv/ (remove venv/ if exists)
- Clean: data/sessions/, schema/ (remove if empty)
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Root directory contains only: src/, docs/, tests/, scripts/, configuration files
- No temporary files visible in ls -la
- Single .venv/ directory only
VALIDATION: ls -la shows clean root with essential files only
COMMIT: "cleanup: remove temporary files and development artifacts"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-11 11:13
NOTES:
- Key decisions: Removed all temporary files and development artifacts from root directory
- Implementation approach: Used rm commands to delete .coverage, audit-report.json, tale.db, .DS_Store, and directories archive/, checkpoints/, htmlcov/, venv/
- Challenges faced: Had to recreate .venv environment and install pre-commit hooks
- Files changed: Removed 9 files/directories, recreated .venv with proper dependencies
- Commit hash: a45fd98
```

#### 2.7.2 - Fix .gitignore File
```

- Remove redundant entries
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- .gitignore prevents all temporary files found in root
- No redundant patterns
- Clear section organization
VALIDATION: git status shows only intended tracked files
COMMIT: "fix(gitignore): prevent temporary file accumulation"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-11 11:46
NOTES:
