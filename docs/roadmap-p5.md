# tale: Detailed Implementation Roadmap -- phase 5

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "1.1.a1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Gathers specified resources
4. Completes implementation
5. Audit's own work, checking for errors, sloppy work, and adherance to engineering best practices.
6. Commits changes before context fills
7. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes




## Phase 5: Documentation and Distribution

DELIVERABLES:
- Cross-platform installation scripts (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Automatic model download and optimization
- Environment validation and prerequisite checking
- Uninstall scripts and data cleanup
ACCEPTANCE: Single command installs complete working system
TEST: tests/test_installation.py - installation testing across platforms
COMMIT: "feat(deploy): add automated installation system"
STATUS: [ ]
NOTES:
```

#### 5.2.a2 - Distribution and Release Management
```
TASK: Professional package distribution with CI/CD
DELIVERABLES:
- PyPI package configuration with proper metadata
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with testing
- Automated release creation with changelog generation
- Version management and backward compatibility
- Security scanning and vulnerability management
ACCEPTANCE: Professional-quality package available for easy installation
TEST: tests/test_packaging.py - package integrity and distribution testing
COMMIT: "feat(release): add professional distribution system"
STATUS: [ ]
NOTES:
```

#### 5.2.DEMO - Final System Demo
```
TASK TYPE: USER DEMO CHECKPOINT
PRIORITY: STOP HERE - Show user complete finished system
DELIVERABLES:
- Complete working system with all features
- Professional documentation and installation
- Production-ready distribution package
- Full system demonstration
USER TEST COMMANDS:
1. pip install tale # Install from PyPI (or pip install -e .)
2. tale init # Initialize system
3. tale chat # Natural conversation with dual models
4. "Build me a complete web application with authentication and database"
5. # Watch complex task decomposition and execution
6. tale dashboard # Monitor system performance
7. # Interrupt and resume, test error recovery
8. tale help # Show comprehensive help system
EXPECTED RESULT: Professional-grade autonomous agent system working end-to-end
STOP INSTRUCTION: Report to user that complete system is finished. Demonstrate all major features working together. This is the final checkpoint - system is ready for release.
STATUS: [ ]
NOTES:
```

## Success Metrics

### Critical Path Validation
1. **Working CLI**: "tale submit 'hello world'" returns a result in under 10 seconds
2. **Dual-Model Efficiency**: UX responses <1s, complex tasks use large model appropriately
3. **Integration Testing**: 100% of system integration tests pass
4. **Performance Targets**: Meet or exceed all architecture performance specifications
5. **Token Efficiency**: 60%+ token savings vs naive single-model approach

### Phase Completion Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Foundation solid with working individual components
- **Phase 2**: Complete working system with UX agent and basic learning
- **Phase 3**: Production dual-model implementation with advanced features
- **Phase 4**: Enterprise-ready with comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- **Phase 5**: Documented, packaged, and ready for distribution

### Quality Gates (ENHANCED)
- All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- All integration tests pass with real servers
- Performance benchmarks meet architecture targets
- Security scan passes with no high-severity issues
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Clean git history with meaningful, descriptive commits
