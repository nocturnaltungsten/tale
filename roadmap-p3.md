# tale: Detailed Implementation Roadmap -- phase 3

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "1.1.a1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Gathers specified resources
4. Completes implementation
5. Audit's own work, checking for errors, sloppy work, and adherance to engineering best practices.
6. Commits changes before context fills
7. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes
