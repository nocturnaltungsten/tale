# tale: Detailed Implementation Roadmap -- phase 4

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "1.1.a1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Gathers specified resources
4. Completes implementation
5. Audit's own work, checking for errors, sloppy work, and adherance to engineering best practices.
6. Commits changes before context fills
7. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes

#### 4.2.DEMO - Production System Demo
```
TASK TYPE: USER DEMO CHECKPOINT
PRIORITY: STOP HERE - Show user production-ready system
DELIVERABLES:
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Production-grade task management
- System running under load
USER TEST COMMANDS:
1. tale stress-test # Run high-load test
2. tale dashboard # Show performance metrics under load
3. # Kill a server process, watch auto-recovery
4. # Submit 100 concurrent tasks, monitor performance
5. tale logs # Show comprehensive logging and monitoring
EXPECTED RESULT: System handles production workloads with graceful error recovery and performance optimization
STOP INSTRUCTION: Report to user that production system is working. Demonstrate load handling, error recovery, and performance optimization. Wait for user approval before continuing to final documentation.
STATUS: [ ]
NOTES:

NOTES:
```

## Success Metrics

### Critical Path Validation
1. **Working CLI**: "tale submit 'hello world'" returns a result in under 10 seconds
2. **Dual-Model Efficiency**: UX responses <1s, complex tasks use large model appropriately
3. **Integration Testing**: 100% of system integration tests pass
4. **Performance Targets**: Meet or exceed all architecture performance specifications
5. **Token Efficiency**: 60%+ token savings vs naive single-model approach

### Phase Completion Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Foundation solid with working individual components
- **Phase 2**: Complete working system with UX agent and basic learning
- **Phase 3**: Production dual-model implementation with advanced features
- **Phase 4**: Enterprise-ready with comprehensive error handling and monitoring

### Quality Gates (ENHANCED)
- All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- All integration tests pass with real servers
- Performance benchmarks meet architecture targets
- Security scan passes with no high-severity issues
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Clean git history with meaningful, descriptive commits
