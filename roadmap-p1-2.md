# tale: Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "1.1.a1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Gathers specified resources
4. Completes implementation
5. Audit's own work, checking for errors, sloppy work, and adherance to engineering best practices.
6. Commits changes before context fills
7. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes


### Critical HTTP Migration Tasks

#### 1.5.e1a - Analyze and Document HTTP Migration Requirements
```
TASK: Read MCP implementation docs and analyze current HTTP/stdio mixed state
RESOURCES:
- dev-docs/# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implement.md
- src/tale/mcp/http_*.py
- src/tale/mcp/base_server.py
DELIVERABLES:
- Create migration-analysis.md documenting:
  * Current stdio usage locations (grep results)
  * HTTP implementation gaps
  * JSON parsing issues in coordinator_http.py
  * Database initialization problems
  * Dependency graph of what needs changing
VALIDATION:
- Run: grep -r "stdio" src/ | grep -v "__pycache__" > stdio_usage.txt
- Run: grep -r "polling" src/ | grep -v "__pycache__" > polling_usage.txt
- Document has clear migration path
COMMIT: "docs(http): analyze HTTP migration requirements"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-08 22:45
NOTES:
- Key decisions: Created comprehensive migration-analysis.md documenting all stdio usage across 6 files and polling usage in execution server
- Implementation approach: Generated grep reports, analyzed HTTP implementation gaps, identified JSON parsing issues in coordinator_http.py line 136
- Challenges faced: None significant - straightforward analysis of existing codebase state
- Performance impact: Analysis only - no runtime changes
- Testing coverage: Created validation commands for stdio/polling usage detection
- Documentation updates: Created complete migration-analysis.md with 3-phase migration plan and success criteria
- Future considerations: Analysis provides clear roadmap for next 7 HTTP migration tasks with proper dependencies
- Dependencies affected: None - this was analysis only
- Key findings: 8 critical files need HTTP migration, coordinator_http.py has JSON parsing bug, execution server uses polling instead of event-driven model
- Migration path: 3 phases covering critical fixes, architecture cleanup, and enhancements
- Commit hash: cffc083
```

#### 1.5.e1b - Fix HTTPCoordinator JSON Parsing
```
TASK: Fix JSON parsing issues in HTTPCoordinator
RESOURCES:
- src/tale/orchestration/coordinator_http.py
- Look for json.loads() calls and string/dict conversion issues
DELIVERABLES:
- Remove unnecessary json.loads() on line 136 (result is already dict)
- Fix any string quote consistency issues
- Add proper type checking before JSON operations
- Add error handling for malformed responses
VALIDATION:
- Run: python -m pytest tests/test_http_mcp_integration.py::TestHTTPMCPIntegration::test_gateway_execution_communication -xvs
- No JSON parsing errors in logs
COMMIT: "fix(http): resolve JSON parsing in HTTPCoordinator"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-08 22:55
NOTES:
- Key decisions: Fixed root cause - HTTP server was using str() instead of json.dumps() for dict serialization
- Implementation approach: Enhanced both HTTP server and coordinator for proper JSON handling
- Challenges faced: Identified that issue was in HTTP MCP server tool result serialization, not just coordinator parsing
- Performance impact: Eliminated JSON parsing errors and improved error handling robustness
- Testing coverage: Created manual test for JSON parsing logic validation
- Documentation updates: Added comprehensive error handling and type checking throughout HTTP communication chain
- Future considerations: HTTP communication now properly handles dict results, strings, and error responses
- Dependencies affected: Fixed both http_server.py and coordinator_http.py for complete solution
- Root cause: HTTP server str(result) created malformed JSON, fixed with json.dumps() for dict results
- Error handling: Added comprehensive JSON parsing with fallback for malformed responses

COMMIT: "fix(http): ensure database initialization in HTTP servers"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-08 10:25
NOTES:
- Key decisions: Fixed Database class to handle in-memory databases with persistent connections, fixed HTTP server JSON serialization
- Implementation approach: Added persistent connection support for :memory: databases, proper dict-to-JSON serialization in HTTP MCP server
- Challenges faced: SQLite :memory: databases create separate instances per connection, requiring persistent connection management
- Performance impact: In-memory databases now work correctly for testing, file databases unchanged
- Testing coverage: All HTTP MCP integration tests pass (4/4), database initialization verified
- Documentation updates: Enhanced Database class with proper in-memory database handling
- Future considerations: Database initialization now works correctly for both file and in-memory databases
- Dependencies affected: None - enhanced existing Database and HTTPMCPServer classes
- Root cause: Each sqlite3.connect(":memory:") creates a new database instance, fixed with persistent connection
- Technical details: Database class now maintains _persistent_conn for :memory: databases, HTTP server uses json.dumps() for dict results

- Challenges faced: Needed to make start() method abstract since different transports handle starting differently
- Performance impact: None - purely architectural cleanup
- Testing coverage: Verified import works, no stdio references remain
- Documentation updates: Updated example usage to reflect abstract nature
- Future considerations: Concrete implementations (HTTPMCPServer, etc.) now properly inherit from abstract base
