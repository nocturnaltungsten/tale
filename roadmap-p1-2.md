# tale: Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each task is designed for a single Claude Code session:
1. Reference the task ID (e.g., "1.1.a1")
2. Claude Code reads the task details
3. Gathers specified resources
4. Completes implementation
5. Audit's own work, checking for errors, sloppy work, and adherance to engineering best practices.
6. Commits changes before context fills
7. Updates this roadmap with [COMPLETE] and notes

- Update ModelPool.initialize() to call _ensure_model_loaded for always_loaded models
- Replace false positive "already loaded" checks with actual VRAM validation
- Add total memory usage validation (should be ≥18GB for both models)
- Update initialization timing to reflect actual load times (5-15 seconds not 0.05s)
- Add comprehensive error handling for load failures
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- After initialize(), ollama ps shows both qwen2.5:7b and qwen3:14b
- Total VRAM usage ≥18GB (6GB + 12GB for the two models)
- Initialize() takes 5-15 seconds (real loading time)
- Method fails fast if either model cannot be loaded
VALIDATION:
- Start with clean ollama (no models loaded)
- Run ModelPool().initialize()
- Verify ollama ps shows both models simultaneously
COMMIT: "fix(models): force load always-loaded models in initialize"
STATUS: [COMPLETE] - 2025-07-09 18:40
NOTES:
- Key decisions: Fixed SimpleOllamaClient.ensure_model_loaded() to call _ensure_model_loaded(), added _validate_dual_model_residency() for VRAM validation
- Implementation approach: Replaced false positive checks with actual VRAM loading, fixed ollama ps parsing to correctly extract memory usage from columns 2&3
- Challenges faced: Debugging ollama ps output parsing - memory size was in parts[2] not parts[1], needed to handle "12 GB" format properly
- Performance impact: Initialization now takes realistic 8.33s (vs 0.05s false positive), both models properly loaded into VRAM simultaneously
- Testing coverage: Comprehensive validation with clean ollama state, verified both models load correctly (qwen2.5:7b 6GB + qwen3:14b 12GB = 18GB total)
- Documentation updates: Enhanced logging with memory usage breakdown and comprehensive error handling
- Future considerations: Model pool now provides genuine VRAM validation, ready for next task on dual model VRAM validation
